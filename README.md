Hi, I'm Ali Renan UyanÄ±k. I'm a university student with a keen interest in staying up-to-date with new technologies.<br>

### .code
I use GitHub mostly to store and synchronize my work.<br>
But I have a few open source projects:
 - [Oblique Projectile Motion](https://github.com/Renanuya/Python-Oblique-Projectile-Motion): Simple physics engine that calculates the angle and velocity of a rocket to hit a ship.
 - [Flutter Onboarding](https://github.com/Renanuya/flutter_onboarding): Replicates the Onboarding interface design of the TaskEz productivity app in Flutter.
